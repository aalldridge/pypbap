Python implementation of Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP) is a profile that allows exchange of Phone Book Objects between devices. It is likely to be used between a car kit and a mobile phone to: * allow the car kit to display the name of the incoming caller; * allow the car kit to download the phone book so the user can initiate a call from the car display
